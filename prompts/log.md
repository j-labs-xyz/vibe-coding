Now do this first:
- Generate the working monorepo scaffold (Next.js web + NestJS API + Postgres + Prisma + Redis + docker-compose).
- Create seed demo data and run instructions.
- Do NOT run terminal commands automatically; instead show me the exact commands to run.
- Keep all edits inside this workspace folder only.
